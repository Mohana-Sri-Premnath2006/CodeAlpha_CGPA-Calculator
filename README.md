# CodeAlpha_CGPA-Calculator
# 🎓 CGPA Calculator (C++)
      

A simple and efficient CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) Calculator built using C++. This project allows users to input grades for multiple subjects and calculates the CGPA based on the entered credit hours and grade points.

---

## 📖 Overview

This C++ project is designed to help students and academic institutions quickly calculate CGPA based on subject-wise credit and grade points. The logic follows standard university GPA rules and provides a user-friendly console interface.

---

## ✨ Features

- Input grades and credit hours for multiple subjects.
- Automatically calculates total grade points and CGPA.
- Simple and interactive command-line interface.
- Error-checking for invalid inputs.
- Lightweight and easy to use.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **📊 GUI Interface**  
  Develop a graphical user interface using libraries like Qt, SFML, or even a web-based frontend for better user experience.

- **🌐 Web Application Integration**  
  Convert the calculator into a web application using a backend like Flask (Python) or Node.js and host it for broader accessibility.

- **📁 File Input/Output**  
  Enable the program to read input data from a file (e.g., CSV or TXT) and write the results to a report file.

- **🧠 Grade Conversion Logic**  
  Add automatic grade-to-point conversion (e.g., A = 10, B = 8, etc.) so users can input grades instead of numeric points.

- **📱 Mobile App Version**  
  Create an Android or iOS app using Flutter or React Native to calculate CGPA on the go.

- **🔐 User Login System**  
  Add authentication to save student profiles and store their academic history securely.

- **📈 Graphical Representation**  
  Show CGPA trends across semesters using bar charts or line graphs.

- **🌍 Localization Support**  
  Add support for multiple languages for international students.

- **💬 Voice Input Integration**  
  Integrate voice command features for hands-free data entry using speech-to-text APIs.

- **✅ Unit Testing & Validation**  
  Add a suite of unit tests to ensure accuracy and prevent bugs during updates.
